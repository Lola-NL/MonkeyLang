# MonkeyLang Syntax

MonkeyLang is designed to be **simple, readable, and easy to use**.  
It follows a **natural language-style** syntax, avoiding symbols like `{}`, `;`, or `()`.

## **General Rules:**
- Commands are **written in simple English**.
- Indentation is not required.
- No semicolons (`;`) are needed.
- Blocks of code are **closed with `end`**.

## **Example Code:**

```monkeylang
create variable x as 10

if x is greater than 5 then
    show "X is large"
else
    show "X is small"
end
```

This structure ensures **readability** while maintaining **flexibility** for advanced use cases.
